# game-of-life

My first small project with C++: \
A small scale implementation of [Conway's game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) using OpenGL and GLFW. The calls are all stored as single bits in an integer array. The shader draws the cells of an integer through bit manipulation. 

# Usage

The simulation can be started/stopped by pressing the Button 'P' on the Keyboard. The state of a cell can be toggled by clicking on it.

# Disclaimer 

I used this project to learn about C++ in general and especially about the interesting uses of preprocessor statements. The program works but it's not really expandable at the moment.
